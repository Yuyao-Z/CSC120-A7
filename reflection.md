Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I overload the constructors in all the subclasses because sometimes we only know the adress and class of the places and method "goUp()" in each sub classes. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Going to TA hours definitely work.
